**SmartDisconnect** is a fabric mod for **Minecraft** that allows you to have a little **confirmation** when leaving as in, if you try leaving nothing happens until you tick the **checkbox**, as that's the only "method" for now.

## Usage
> Let's say you were in an eventâ€”one were you couldn't just leave and join back, and you alt tab on to let's say discord, when you alt tab back and click there's a chance that you accidentally click disconnect, this can even happening when going into the escape menu if you are too "fast"; basically this solves that unless you really mess up and somehow click the tick box and press disconnect. That's all.
